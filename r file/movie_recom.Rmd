# Introduction

<div align="justify">Ages ago, before machines got introduced. When there are no recommendation systems. Users need to rely on the suggestions and recommendations that are done by other people or from reviews that come in articles. Now, it became simple to recommend products to the users based on their interests and habits. It is possible for business organizations to exploit the usage of these Recommendation Systems by suggesting items that are lovable to the users. This would ultimately helps the organizations to increase their profits. We all know about the entertainment applications such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and so on. Ever wondered how these applications suggest or recommend the movies which are appealing to us. This is only possible with something known as the Recommendation System. This system is used in these applications to learn watching patterns of the user and recommends the movies accordingly. We all came across these systems once in a while. These systems are not only used in entertainment applications but they were also used in Online shopping applications such as Amazon, Ebay and Bestbuy.

We are working on Movie Recommender System which helps the user by recommending the top movies based on his/her preferences and ratings history

There are three algorithms which helps us to build Recommender Systems

1. Popularity based Filtering 
2. Content based Filtering 
3. User based Collaborative Filtering

**Popularity based Filtering:**

  This is a simple Recommender System which recommends the movies to all users in a generalized way based on popularity. The basic idea behind this is that the user likes the movies which are highly popular. So, we cannot expect user preference based recommendations in this model.</div>

**Content based Filtering:**

<div align="justify">  This is a Recommender System which recommends the movies by his/her preference and their data. This system does not take any data from other users. The basic idea behind this model is if the user likes one movie he may like the movies which are similar to it. Attributes such as genre, director, description and actors will be used by this model.</div>
  
![](B:/my-work/kdd/final/Movie_Recommender/content_based.png)

**Collaborative based Filtering**

<div align="justify">  This is a Recommender System which recommends the movies by his/her preference and it also considers data of other similar users. The watch history of every user will be used in this algorithm. The basic idea behind this model is that movies watched by one user are recommended to similar users. On using Collaborative based filtering, the outcome of the recommendation is obtained from multiple users’ data and it doesn’t rely on single user data.</div

<div align="justify">  The main motivation behind doing this project is the Netflix application. It suggests movies according to my interests. So, it raised a bean of curiosity to learn more about these recommendation systems and how it works.
  
  We built a recommender system using the three algorithms mentioned above and also observed how best these algorithms worked.

</div>

# Related Work
<div align="justify">
We went through various academic papers to complete this work. We got to know how to build a data mining pipeline[1]. We learnt business purposes of recommendation systems. This research paper helped us to know the implementation of the Movie Recommendation Systems[2]. We learnt the details of evaluation of model from this paper[5]. These references helped us to finish our work efficiently without any hardships. There is possibility of building Hybrid Recommendation models[2]. We came across these Hybrid Recommendation Systems in our research. We are going to save this Hybrid model as the future progress of our work.</div>

# Methods
<div align="justify">
For this Recommender Systems to work we need a dataset of movies with ratings and popularity. And we also need metadata of the movie to build a Content based Filtering model.

There’s a dataset called “The Movies Dataset” on the Kaggle website which consists of data which is suitable for our project. The metadata of 45000 movies are available in this data. It is taken from MovieLens Dataset. These files contain movies released before 2017. Attributes such as cast, crew, keywords, overview, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, countries, vote counts and vote averages are contained in this dataset. 26 million ratings of all the movies are also present in this file. These ratings are obtained from a website called GroupLens.</div>

```

**Data Preparation**
<div align="justify">
We collected the data from the Kaggle website and MovieLens website to build Recommender Systems using three different approaches.</div>

**Data Cleaning:**
<div align="justify">
We removed the rows which contain Null values.
We removed all the duplicate values present in the data.
We changed data-types of particular columns to do the computation according to our requirement.
</div>
**Data Filtering:**
<div align="justify">
We removed the unwanted columns in our dataset. This will also reduce the burden to the system.
We added a few extra columns from existing columns which helped us to do Analysis.
</div
**Outliers Removal:**
<div align="justify">
We removed only the one outlier present in our data.</div>

```{r}
# removing rows that contains
movies_md[movies_md=="[]"] = NA
movies_md = na.omit(movies_md)

dim(movies_md)

# removing duplicate rows

names(movies_md)[6] =  "m_id"
movies_md = distinct(movies_md)

dim(movies_md)

summary(movies_md)

# changing data types for particular columns

movies_md$release_date = as.Date(movies_md$release_date)
movies_md$revenue = as.numeric(movies_md$revenue)
movies_md$budget = as.numeric(movies_md$budget)

summary(movies_md)

#adding a new column year for detailed analysis
movies_md$year = format(movies_md$release_date,format="%Y")
movies_md$year = as.integer(movies_md$year)

glimpse(movies_md)

# Filtering data by removing unwanted columns
movies_filtered = filter(movies_md, revenue > 1000000, budget > 1000, runtime > 0) %>%
  # Removing unwanted columns
  select(-"adult", -"belongs_to_collection", -"homepage", -"overview", -"poster_path", -"status", -"video", -"tagline", -"production_companies", -"production_countries", -"spoken_languages") %>%
  # Adding columns for net return and Return on investment (ROI) to see which movies collected most at box-office
  mutate(net_return = revenue - budget, ROI = net_return / budget * 100) 

movies_filtered = movies_filtered[ !(movies_filtered$m_id %in% c(363093)), ]

## Popularity based Model
<div align="justify">
This is a simple model we created using basic idea that is, users are more likely to watch the movies which collected more revenue. These are the results that we obtained. We can see those movies are highly appraised movies. But there is lack of user preference in this model. But we can use this model to attract large mass of population rather than a single user.
</div>

```{r}
top_10 = movies_filtered %>% arrange(desc(revenue)) %>% slice(1:10)
top_10_titles = data.frame(top_10$original_title)
print(top_10_titles)
```

**Data Preparation for Content-based approach**

```{r}
movies_df = read.csv("B:/my-work/kdd/final/Movie_Recommender/movies.csv")
head(movies_df)
dim(movies_df)

ratings_df = read.csv("B:/my-work/kdd/final/Movie_Recommender/ratings_small.csv")
ratings_df = ratings_df[1:3]
head(ratings_df)
dim(ratings_df)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# we are going to make content-based filtering using Genre attribute

genres_df = as.data.frame(movies_df$genres, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(genres_df)
library(data.table)
genres_separated = as.data.frame(tstrsplit(genres_df[,1], '[|]', type.convert=TRUE), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
colnames(genres_separated) = c(1:7)
genres_separated = subset(genres_separated,select = c(1:7))


genre_list = c("Action", "Adventure", "Animation", "Children", "Comedy", "Crime","Documentary",
               "Drama", "Fantasy","Film-Noir", "Horror", "Musical", "Mystery",
               "Romance","Sci-Fi", "Thriller", "War", "Western")

genre_matrix = matrix(0,62424,18)
genre_matrix[1,] = genre_list

colnames(genre_matrix) = genre_list

for (i in 1:nrow(genres_separated)) {
  for (j in 1:ncol(genres_separated)) {
    genmat_col = which(genre_matrix[1,] == genres_separated[i,j])
    genre_matrix[i+1,genmat_col] = 1
  }
}

genre_matrix2 <- as.data.frame(genre_matrix[-1,], stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
for (c in 1:ncol(genre_matrix2)) {
  genre_matrix2[,c] <- as.integer(genre_matrix2[,c])
}

glimpse(genre_matrix2)
```

```{r}
# Creating Binary class data frame from ratings to see whether user likes movie or not

  if (binaryratings[i,3] > 3){
    binaryratings[i,3] = 1
  }
  else{
    binaryratings[i,3] = -1
  }
}

binaryratings2 = dcast(binaryratings, movieId~userId, value.var = "rating", na.rm=FALSE)

  if (result[i,j] < 0){
    result[i,j] = 0
  }
  else {
    result[i,j] = 1
  }
}
}


```

## Content Based Filtering approach

```{r}
# recommendations for user1

result2 = result[,1]#First user's profile
result2
sim_mat = rbind.data.frame(result2, genre_matrix3)
sim_mat = data.frame(lapply(sim_mat,function(x){as.integer(x)})) 
sim_mat[1,] #user liked genres

library(proxy)
sim_results = dist(sim_mat, method = "Cosine")
sim_results = as.data.frame(as.matrix(sim_results[1:8863]))
rows = which(sim_results == min(sim_results))
#Recommended movies
movies_df[rows,]

```
```{r}
# recommendations for user2

result2 = result[,2]#Second user's profile
result2
sim_mat = rbind.data.frame(result2, genre_matrix3)
sim_mat = data.frame(lapply(sim_mat,function(x){as.integer(x)})) 
sim_mat[1,] #user liked genres

library(proxy)
sim_results = dist(sim_mat, method = "Cosine")
sim_results = as.data.frame(as.matrix(sim_results[1:8863]))
rows = which(sim_results == min(sim_results))
#Recommended movies

movies_df[rows,]

```

**Data Preparation for User-Based Collaborative filtering approach**

We used recommenderlab package to build this model.

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Data preparation
library(reshape2)

ratingmat = dcast(ratings_df, userId~movieId, value.var = "rating", na.rm=FALSE)
ratingmat = as.matrix(ratingmat[,-1])

#install.packages("recommenderlab", repos = "https://mhahsler.r-universe.dev")
#install.packages("matrixStats", type = "binary")
#install.packages('BBmisc')

library(recommenderlab)
library(BBmisc)


ratingmat2 = as(ratingmat, "realRatingMatrix")

#binarize the data
ratingmat_bin = binarize(ratingmat2,minRating=3)
```

## User-Based Collaborative Filtering

```{r}
#Creating Recommender Model. "UBCF" stands for User-Based Collaborative Filtering

recommender_model = Recommender(ratingmat_bin, method = "UBCF", param=list(method="Cosine",nn=30))
recom = predict(recommender_model, ratingmat2[1], n=10) #Obtain top 10 recommendations for 1st user in dataset
recom_list = as(recom, "list")

#Obtain recommendations
recom_result = matrix(0,10)
for (i in c(1:10)){
  recom_result[i] = movies_df[as.integer(recom_list[[1]][i]),2]
}

print(recom_result)
```

```{r}
recommender_model2 = Recommender(ratingmat_bin, method = "UBCF", param=list(method="Cosine",nn=30))
recom = predict(recommender_model2, ratingmat2[2], n=10) #Obtain top 10 recommendations for 2nd user in dataset
recom_list = as(recom, "list")

#Obtain recommendations
recom_result = matrix(0,10)
for (i in c(1:10)){
  recom_result[i] = movies_df[as.integer(recom_list[[1]][i]),2]
}

print(recom_result)
```

The Basic methodology we used is below: 

![methodology](B:/my-work/kdd/final/Movie_Recommender/methodolgy.png)

# Results and Discussion

We evaluated our models by using recommenderlab package present in R language. The results are as below.

# Evaluation

```{r}
# Evaluation of models


scheme = evaluationScheme(ratingmat2, method = 'cross-validation',k = 5, given = -1,goodRating = 5)

algs = list('popular' = list(name = 'POPULAR',param = NULL),
             'IBCF' = list(name = 'IBCF',parameter = list(method = "Cosine")),
             'UBCF' = list(name = 'UBCF',param = list(nn = 30)))

set.seed(1)
results_list = evaluate(scheme,method = algs,type = 'ratings')

library(dplyr)
labels = c('RMSE','MSE','MAE')
results = avg(results_list) %>% unlist() %>% as.data.frame()
results$label  = labels
results$method = row.names(results)
colnames(results)[1]  = 'RMSE'
library(ggplot2)
results %>% filter(label == 'RMSE') %>% ggplot(aes(reorder(method,-RMSE),RMSE)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```
<div align="justify">
We evaluated ou model with the parameter **RMSE**. RMSE for every model is low. 

Every model has its own advantages and disadvantages.
</div>
# Conclusion
<div align="justify">
We built three types of recommendation systems. But there are other models out there. We have a data of only 671 users and their reviews which might not be the sufficient data for proper Recommendation System. Our work is better as far as possible. 

There are advantages and disadvantages of every model. So, There are Hybrid Recommendation System which overcomes the disadvantages of these models. </div>

**Disadvantages**

**Popularity based model** - There is no user preference.

**Content based model** - The proper data distribution is mandatory for the model to work efficiently

**User based Collaborative model** - This model takes more memory as it should calculate similarity among every user. If number of users are in millions. It will take more time for computation.

So, the future scope of our project will be building Hybrid Recommendation System.
